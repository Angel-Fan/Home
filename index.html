		<h3>Three Finger Salute</h3>
			<p>The Three Finger Salute is used by District 12 residents when they have to say thanks or just to show that the person is loved and respected by them. It's a gesture of admiration, gratitude and saying goodbye to someone you love.</p>
			<p>The sign is made by pressing your three middle fingers of your left hand to your lips and then hold them out to the person, or people, that you want to show respect to. In the books, the left hand is used, but in the first film it is the right hand, and the fingers are simply held up by their side. After holding out your hand you would whistle 4 notes: G, Bb, A, and D. This is because the four notes were Rue's signal for Katniss. After Rue died, Katniss directly faced the cameras, performed the three finger salute and whistled Rue's Song in honour of her.</p>

		<h3>The Hanging Tree</h3>
			<p>When Katniss was younger, her father would take her to the woods with him and teach her how to hunt. When they were in the woods, Katniss' father taught her the song "The Hanging Tree". Jennifer Lawrence actually recorded a soundtrack of "The Hanging Tree" for the movies.</p>
